[#v0_42_0_new_features]
=== New features

lib/http: add methods PutForm and PutFormData on Client::
+
--
The PutForm method send the PUT request with params set in body using
content type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".

The PutFormData method send the PUT request with params set in body
using content type "multipart/form-data".

lib/websocket: fix test for the Go 1.20::
+
--
In the next Go release (1.20), parsing URL with invalid percent escape
will not throw error anymore [1].

--

lib/ascii: seed math/rand to fix the example for Random function::
+
--
In the next Go release, the math/rand is globally seed randomly [1].
This cause our example for Random is always fail.

The fix is to seed it manually using predefined number.

[#v0_41_3]
==  share v0.41.3 (2022-11-05)

[#v0_41_3_bug_fixes]
===  Bug fixes

lib/http: sanitize ServerUrl and request path::
+
--
This is to fix double slash in case the ServerUrl end with it and the
request path begin with it.
For example, "http://127.0.0.1/" and "/" should send request to
"http://127.0.0.1/" not "http://127.0.0.1//".
--

lib/ssh: try both ssh agent and IdentityFile::
+
--
If ~/.ssh/config contains a Host section with IdentityFile directive specified
and SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable is also set, but ssh_config
section does not specify "IdentityAgent none" explicitly, the NewClientFromConfig
returns an error saying

  NewClient: ssh: handshake failed: ssh: unable to authenticate, attempted
    methods [none publickey], no supported methods remain.

This changes fix this by dialing remote server twice.
--

ssh/sftp: set FileAttrs.name to filename::
+
--
Current implementation exposes dirEntry.filename as fs.DirEntry.Name().
However fs.DirEntry.Info().Name() is always empty string.
--

[#v0_41_3_enhancement]
===  Enhancements

lib/ssh: add private key to agent once client connected successfully::
+
--
In NewClientFromConfig, if Client connect using IdentityFile instead of
agent and its success, we add the private key to agent directly.

Unfortunately, since we did not know which key is being negotiated, we
add all private keys parsed from IdentityFile.
--

ssh/config: change the method GenerateSigners to Signers::
+
--
This is to make the method compatible with ssh.PublicKeysCallback.

Each parsed and unsigned IdentityFile is stored in field PrivateKeys,
replacing the Signers field (which is conflict with method names).
--


[#v0_41_2]
==  share v0.41.2 (2022-10-10)

[#v0_41_2_bug_fixes]
===  Bug fixes

lib/websocket: check for EAGAIN and EINTR when reading raw socket::
+
--
This fix tests that sometimes fail when running with -count=X, where
X > 1,

	$ go test -race -count=30 -timeout=30s ./lib/websocket

Upon inspecting, when client sending larger payload, for example
65536 bytes, server sometimes only read half of them and return an
error "resource temporarily unavailable" or
"interrupted system call".
--

lib/websocket: fix possible data race on Client::
+
--
The Client have method send that check if the underlying connection (conn)
has been closed or not.
Since the conn can be closed anytime, for example server send to the
control CLOSE frame:

	recv -> handleFrame -> handleClose -> Quit

we need to guard the conn with Mutex before calling send to prevent
data race.
--

[#v0_41_2_enhancements]
=== Enhancements

lib/websocket: cleanup the channel gracefulClose during Close::
+
--
When calling Close, we initialize the internal channel gracefulClose
so the client can check the close response from server on another
goroutine serve() and signal back to Close to continue the closing
process.

This channel is never closed and nil-ed again after Close which
may cause resource leaks.

While at it, use sendClose to minimize duplicate code.
--

[#v0_41_2_chores]
=== Chores

lib/websocket: replace handleInvalidData and BadRequest with sendClose::
+
Both of those functions actually call send control CLOSE frame and not
exported.
So, instead of duplicating it, we replace it with sendClose.

lib/websocket: rewords some comment and package documentation::


[#v0_41_1]
==  share v0.41.1 (2022-10-07)

[#v0_41_1_enhancements]
===  Enhancements

lib/http: simplify the default user-agent that send by Client::
+
Remove the comment string, no need to be explicit about it.

lib/http: support embedded field on UnmarshalForm::

lib/test: use text/diff to compare strings on Assert::
+
--
If both exp and got types are string and its longer than 50 chars, it
will use the text/diff.Text to show the difference between them.
The diff output is as follow,

	!!! string not matched:
	--++
	<LINE_NUM> - "<LINE_EXP>"
	<LINE_NUM> + "<LINE_GOT>"
	^<COL_NUM> - "<DELETED_STRING>"
	^<COL_NUM> + "<INSERTED_STRING>"

The "<LINE_NUM> - " print the line number in exp followed by line itself.
The "<LINE_NUM> + " print the line number in got followed by line itself.
The "^<COL_NUM> - " show the character number in exp line followed by
deleted string (or string that not exist in got).
The "^<COL_NUM> + " show the character number in got line followed by
inserted string (or string that not exist in exp).
--

lib/reflect: remove prefix from returned error on DoEqual::
+
Prefixing an error cause may cause confusion when used on
lib/test.Assert.
The returned error from test.Assert will print "DoEqual: ...", where
user never call DoEqual in their test.

lib/test: change the Assert parameter to Writer::
+
--
Since we only need to call Log and Fatalf during Assert, no need to pass
the whole instance of testing.T to Assert.
By changing it to Writer, we also can test the Assert.

This remove the AssertBench, because it have the same function
parameters and body as Assert.
--

[#v0_41_1_chores]
===  Chores

all: fix some tests with -count=X, where X>1::
+
The fixed test are in package lib/dns, lib/http, lib/smtp, lib/git, and
email/dkim.

lib/ini: add example for marshaling slice inside map[string]T::
+
While at it, clean up some codes to make it more readable and debug-able.

lib/paseto: reformat the documentation::

lib/websocket: fix possible race during testing Client::
+
During testing the Client we use the un-exported method send,
while the test cases itself may close the connection and we did not
guard it.

text/diff: rewrite the test again by reading from files::
+
The goal is to remove dependency to lib/test so we can use text/diff
in the lib/test in the future.


[#v0_41_0]
==  share v0.41.0 (2022-09-04)

[#v0_41_0_breaking_changes]
===  Breaking changes

lib/json: remove solidus (slash) from being escaped/un-escaped::
+
--
The standard json package does not escape the solidus, even though the
RFC said so.
Someone also report this as an error in
https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid3159[RFC 3159^]
by removing solidus from list of escaped characters but the author itself
reject it.
--

[#v0_41_0_bug_fixes]
===  Bug fixes

lib/memfs: fix SIGSEGV when node is deleted when being watched::
+
--
The panic is caused by the item in slice of Childs is being
removed during iteration.

To fix this, we remove the childs on the second iteration after
we remove any sub directories inside them.
--

[#v0_41_0_new_features]
===  New features

lib/text: add custom MarshalJSON to type Chunk and Line::

[#v0_41_0_chores]
=== Chores

lib/memfs: simplify checking for symlink::
+
--
Instead of calling filepath.EvalSymlink and Lstat, call os.Stat directly
to the symlink system path.

This also fix the modTime not currently set to the original file when
creating Node from symlink-ed file.
--

lib/http: increase time sleep waiting for server on example endpoint::
+
--
On container, sometimes the test fail with the following error

----
2022-08-28 19:32:21 UTC DefaultErrorHandler: POST /error/custom:
    Custom error
2022/08/28 19:32:22 Do: Get "http://127.0.0.1:7016/?":
    dial tcp 127.0.0.1:7016: connect: connection refused
FAIL	git.sr.ht/~shulhan/pakakeh.go/lib/http	1.583s
----

This was caused by server is not ready yet to accept connection when
testing executed.
--

text/diff: rewrite the test using test.Data::
+
Using test.Data provide much more readable input and outputs and
simplify modifying the test data instead of manually define the
expected output in struct.

_doc: cleaning up the documentation::
+
--
In the _doc, we remove generated HTML files.

In the index, we add link to README and section about Development that
include links to repository, issues, and patches.

In the README, we reformat it to use AsciiDoc markup, remove the
sanitizer library, add CLI for epoch, ini, and xtrk.
--

lib/totp: cleaning up the codes::
+
This changes replace ":=" with explicit variable declarations and use
raw string literal whenever possible.

[#v0_40_0]
==  share v0.40.0 (2022-08-05)

[#v0_40_0_breaking_changes]
===  Breaking changes

lib/memfs: set the Root SysPath to the first MemFS instance on Merge::
+
--
Previously, calling Merge(...), set the merged MemFS Root.SysPath to
"..".
Since we allow the TryDirect to access the file directly (if its set
to true), this may cause the file system leaks if returned MemFS set
this flag to true.

To prevent that, we set the SysPath to the first MemFS SysPath.
--

lib/memfs: rename Option field Development to TryDirect::
+
--
This changes the usage of Development flag.

TryDirect define a flag to bypass file in memory.
If its true, any call to Get will try direct read to file system.

This flag has several use cases.
First, to test serving file system directly from disk during
development.
Second, to combine embedded MemFS instance with non-embedded instance.
One is reading content from memory, one is reading content from disk
directly.
--


[#v0_40_0_new_features]
===  New features

_bin: add script to run Go benchmark::
+
--
The go-bench.sh accept two arguments: the method or function to benchmark,
default to "."; and benchmark number, default to current timestamp
YYYYmmDD-HHMM.
--

_bin: add script to run Go test and generate HTML coverage::
+
--
The script accept one single argument: the path to package to
be tested.
If its empty default to current directory and sub-directories.
--

_bin: add script go-mod-tip.sh::
+
--
The go-mod-tip shell script get and print the latest Go module
version based on the last tag and the latest commit hash from the
current working directory.

This command usually used to fix go.mod due to force commit.
--
cmd/epoch: print the weekday in local and UTC time::

cmd/epoch: add flag to parse time from RFC3339 and RFC1123 format::
+
--
The flag for RFC1123 comes with two options one with string timezone
(-rfc1123) and one with numeric time zone (-rfc1123z).
--

cmd/ini: a CLI to get and set values in the INI file format::
+
--
This is the CLI that implements the lib/ini for getting and setting
the key's value from INI file.
--

lib/test: implement Data, a type to load formatted file for helping test::
+
--
Data contains predefined input and output values that is loaded from
file to be used during test.

The data provides zero or more flags, an optional description, zero or
more input, and zero or more output.

The data file name must end with ".txt".

The data content use the following format,

	[FLAG_KEY ":" FLAG_VALUE LF]
	[LF DESCRIPTION]
	LF
	">>>" [INPUT_NAME] LF
	INPUT_CONTENT
	LF
	"<<<" [OUTPUT_NAME] LF
	OUTPUT_CONTENT

The data can contains zero or more flag.
A flag is key and value separated by ":".
The flag key must not contain spaces.

The data may contain description.

The line that start with "\\n>>>" defined the beginning of input.
An input can have a name, if its empty it will be set to "default".
An input can be defined multiple times, with different names.

The line that start with "\\n<<<" defined the beginning of output.
An output can have a name, if its empty it will be set to "default".
An output also can be defined multiple times, with different names.

[#v0_40_0_bug_fixes]
===  Bug fixes

lib/ini: fix parsing and saving multi line variables::
+
--
Previously, if INI file contains multi line variables, for example

	key = a \
		b

The Get and saved value is "a \\tb", where it should be "a b" for Get and
"a \\\\\\n\\t\\b" again when saved.

This changes require refactoring how the variable's value is parsed and
stored.
A variable value is parsed and stored from character after "=" until new
line or comment as raw value, and the real value is derived by trimming
white spaces, handle escaped character and double quotes.
--

lib/ini: fix marshaling pointer to nil field::
+
--
If the field is pointer, the code will thrown panic if its point to
nil struct or print "<invalid reflct.Value>" for String.
--

lib/memfs: ignore error on Get when calling node Update::
+
--
If node exist in memory, error on Update does not means the file is not
exist.
The node may have been embedded and then merged with other MemFS instance
with Development flag set to true.
--

[#v0_40_0_enhancements]
===  Enhancements

lib/dns: add field SOA to the ServerOptions::
+
--
The SOA field defined the root authority for all zones and records
served under the Server.
--

lib/http: add server options to generate index.html automatically::
+
--
If the EnableIndexHtml in the ServeOptions enabled, server generate
list of files inside the requested path as HTML.
--

lib/ini: support escaped double-quote and colon in tag subsection::
+
--
A colon `:` is escaped using double backslash `\\\\`, for example
`a:b\\\\:c:d` contains section `a`, subsection `b:c`, and variable `d`.

A double quote `"` is escaped using triple backslash, for example
(`\\\\\\"`).

all: move lib/sanitize.HTML to net/html.Sanitize::
+
--
Since the sanitize package only contains HTML function, and the html
package already exist, we move the function into html package.
--

===  New features

lib/mlog: add method Close to MultiLogger::
+
--
The Close method flush and close all log forwarders.
Any write to a closed MultiLogger will be ignored.

This changes require adding sync.Mutex to mark if the instance has been
closed or not; which affect createMultiLogger and defaultMLog to return
a pointer to prevent copy on Mutex.
--

lib/clise: implement json.Marshaler on Clise::
+
--
The MarshalJSON method convert the Clise into slice by calling Slice
and then convert it into JSON.
--

lib/reflect: add function Marshal::
+
--
The Marshal function marshal the obj value to []byte by calling one of
the method: MarshalBinary, MarshalJSON, or MarshalText; in respective
order.

If obj implement one of the method with valid signature, it will return
(out, nil, true);
unless there is an error.

If the method signature invalid it will return (nil, err, false).

If obj is nil or none of the method exist it will return
(nil, nil, false).
--

net/html: add function NormalizeForID::
+
--
Given an input string, The NormalizeForID normalize it to HTML ID.
The normalization follow Mozilla specification [1] rules,

* it must not contain whitespace (spaces, tabs etc.),
* only ASCII letters, digits, '_', and '-' should be used, and
* it should start with a letter.

The NormalizeForID do this normalization,

* An empty string is equal to "\_".
* Any other unknown characters will be replaced with '\_'.
* If the input does not start with letter, it will be prefixed with
  '\_', unless it start with '\_'.
* All letters converted to lower case.

lib/http: add function to unmarshal url.Values using tag `form:`::
+
--
UnmarshalForm read struct fields tagged with `form:` from out as key and
set its using the value from url.Values based on that key.
If the field does not have `form:` tag but it is exported, then it will
use the field name, in case insensitive.

Only the following types are supported: bool, int/intX, uint/uintX,
floatX, string, []byte, or type that implement BinaryUnmarshaler
(UnmarshalBinary), json.Unmarshaler (UnmarshalJSON), or TextUnmarshaler
(UnmarshalText).

A bool type can be set to true using the following string value: "true",
"yes", or "1".

If the input contains multiple values but the field type is not slice,
the field will be set using the first value.

It will return an error if the out variable is not set-able (the type is
not a pointer to a struct).
It will not return an error if one of the input value is not match with
field type.
--

lib/reflect: implement Set function to set reflect.Value by string::
+
--
The Set function set the obj value by converting the string val from
parameter to the obj type.

If the obj is an interface or struct, its value will be set by calling
Unmarshal.

It will return an error if,

* obj is not setable, variable is passed without pointer or pointer
    not initialized.
* val is overflow
* obj Kind is Invalid, Array, Chan, Func, Map, or UnsafePointer.
--

lib/reflect: add function Unmarshal::
+
--
The Unmarshal function set the obj value by calling one of the method:
UnmarshalBinary, UnmarshalJSON, or UnmarshalText; in respective
order.

Just like reflect, the obj value must be pointer to initialized variable
(&T) or pointer-to-pointer to uninitialized variable (**T).

If obj implement one of the method, it will return (true, nil) if there is
no error.

If none of the method exist on obj, it will return (false, nil).
--

lib/reflect: add function Tag to simplify lookup on struct's field tag::
+
--
Given a StructField and the name of tag, return the tag's value and
options inside the tag.
The options is any string after tag's value, separated by comma.
For example, given the following field definition

	F `tag:"name,opt1, opt2"`

It will return (name, [opt1 opt2], true).

If the field is exported but does not have tag, it will return the field
name (as is without converting to lower case) in val with hasTag is
false: (Name, nil, false).

If the field is un-exported it will return empty val with hasTag is
false ("", nil, false).

This release update the minimum Go version to 1.17.

===  Breaking changes

*  lib/dns: move all caches operations from Server to Caches type
+
--
Previously all caches operation are tied to the Server type.

In order to separate the responsibilities between server and caches,
we move all caches operations to Cache type.
--

*  lib/dns: change the Zone SOA field type from ResourceRecord to RDataSOA
+
--
Using the RDataSOA type directly minimize interface check and conversion.
--

[#v0_38_0_enhancements]
===  Enhancements

*  lib/dns: replace Ticker with Timer on Caches' worker
+
Since the worker call time.Now() inside the body, we can minimize it
by using Timer.

*  lib/dns: export the Caches type and field on Server
+
The idea is move all server's caches operations (methods) to this
type later.

*  lib/dns: split storage between internal and external caches
+
--
Previously, the indexed caches for internal (records from hosts or zone
files) and external (records from parent name servers) are stored inside
single map.

This changes split those internal and external caches into two maps,
so any operation on one caches does not affect the other one, and vice
versa.
--

*  lib/dns: return the removed record on caches RemoveCachesByRR
+
--
If the record being removed found on caches, it will return it;
otherwise it will return nil without error.
--

*  lib/dns: disable JSON marshaling Zone Records field
+
--
On service that manage many zones, providing an API to fetch list of
zones only will return large payload if we include the Records field
in the response.

So, it is recommended to provide another API to fetch the records on
specific zone.
--

*  lib/dns: print the field Value on ResourceRecord Stringer instead of rdlen

*  lib/dns: export the zoneRecords type
+
--
Since the Zone type is exported and its contains exported field Records
with type zoneRecords, then that field type should also exported.
--

*  lib/dns: return the deleted record on HostsFile RemoveRecord
+
--
Previously, the RemoveRecord method on HostsFile return a boolean
true if the record found.

This changes the return type to the ResourceRecord being deleted,
to allow the caller inspect and/or print the record.
--

[#v0_38_0_chores]
===  Chores

*  all: rewrite all codes to use "var" instead of ":="
+
--
Using ":=" simplify the code but we lose the type.  For example,

	v := F()

The only way we know what the type of v is by inspecting the function
F.
Another disadvantages of using ":=" may cause extra variables
allocation where two or more variables with same type is declared
inside body of function where it could be only one.

While at it, we split the struct for test case into separate type.
--

*  lib/memfs: format comment in embedded Go template according to gofmt tip
+
--
In the next gofmt (Go v1.19), the comment format does not allow empty
lines "//" at the top and bottom of the comment.

This changes make the generated Go code from Embed method to match
as close as possible with output of gofmt.

===  Breaking changes

*  lib/dns: refactor Server RemoveCachesByNames to return removed Answer
+
--
Previously, RemoveCachesByNames does not return anything, its only
print the domain name being removed if debugging level is set to >= 1.

This changes rewrite the RemoveCachesByNames to return list of Answer
being removed to allow the caller to inspect and/or print the Answer.
--

*  lib/memfs: change the Watch method to accept struct
+
--
Previously, we assume that the list of files being Watch-ed is same
with the list of files in Includes.
This may not be correct.
For example, we may want to watch "*.ts" files only but did not want
it to be included during GoEmbed.

This changes introduce list of pattern for files to be watched in
the `WatchOptions.Watches` field.
If this field is empty, only files match the Includes filter will be
watched.
--

[#v0_37_0_new_features]
===  New features

*  lib/dns: add method to get the record in HostsFile by name and/or value
+
--
The Get method return the first resource record that match with domain
name and/or value.
The value parameter is optional, if its empty, then only the first record
that match with domain name that will be returned.

If no record matched, it will return nil.

While at it, reformat the hosts_file comments with next Go 1.19 format.
--

*  lib/dns: add method CachesClear to remove all caches

*  lib/net: add method to populate query on ResolvConf
+
--
Given a domain name to be resolved, the PopulateQuery generate
list of names to be queried based on registered Domain and Search
in the resolv.conf file.

The domain name itself will be on top of the list if its contains any
dot.

*  lib/dns: add function to create new client using name server URL
+
--
The NewClient create new DNS client using the name server URL.
The name server URL is defined in the same format as ServerOptions's
NameServer.

The function also accept second parameter: isInsecure, which is only
usable for DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS.

While at it, split the example for marshaling and unmarshaling
struct into separate examples.

*  lib/memfs: make the Node's addChild to be idempotent
+
If the same Node's Path already exists on the Childs, adding another
Node with same Path should not add the Node to the Childs.

*  lib/ini: implement marshaling and unmarshaling map with struct element
+
--
For a field F with type map[K]S `ini:"sec"`, where K is string and S is
a struct or pointer to struct element, marshaling the field F will
result in the following ini format,

	[sec "K"]
	<S.Field.Tag> = <S.Field.Value>

Each field in struct S unmarshaled normally as "key = value".

This rule is also applied when unmarshalling from ini text into map[K]V.

This implementation allow multiple section with dynamic subsections as
key.

*  lib/memfs: update the file mode and/or content on DirWatcher
+
Previously, the DirWatcher only forward the NodeState if the file being
watched is deleted or modified.
+
This changes the DirWatcher handle it internally.
If the file is deleted it will be removed from internal MemFS instance.
If the file is updated it will update the mode or content of that file
in the MemFS.

*  lib/memfs: changes the DirWatcher and Watcher to use channel
+
Previously, we use a callback model to propagated changes.
This model has its advantages and disadvantages.
+
The advantages is there is no limit of queue when the changes need to
be propagated to the caller.
The disadvantages of that the watcher needs to wait for callback to
finish before continue processing.
One can run it under goroutine, but it may cause race if the caller does
not handle update properly and it does not guarantee the goroutine
process it in FIFO.
We can see this on the unit test of NewWatcher, we needs to use
sync.WaitGroup to properly check one changes before processing the order.
+
This commit changes the DirWatcher and Watcher to use channel, like
the one in time.Ticker.

*  all: move the DirWatcher and Watcher types from io to memfs
+
There are two reasons why we move them.
First, DirWatcher and Watcher code internally depends on the memfs
package, especially on Node type.
Second, we want to add new Watch method to MemFS which depends on
package io.
If we do that, there will be circular imports.

===  New features

*  lib/http: implement handler to check each request to Server Memfs
+
The FSHandler define the function to inspect each GET request to Server
MemFS instance.
The node parameter contains the requested file inside the memfs.
+
If the handler return true, server will continue processing the node
(writing the Node content type, body, and so on).
+
If the handler return false, server stop processing the node and return
immediately, which means the function should have already handle writing
the header, status code, and/or body.

*  lib/memfs: add method to stop the Watch
+
The StopWatch method stop watching for update, from calling Watch.

*  lib/xmlrpc: add method to get boolean field value on Value
+
The GetFieldAsBoolean return the struct's field value by its key as
bool type.

*  lib/memfs: add method Watch to MemFS
+
The Watch method create and start a DirWatcher that ready to be consumed.
+
This is to simplify watching an existing MemFS instance because the
internal fs inside the DirWatcher is not exported.

*  lib/http: use package mlog for logging

In case the consumer of lib/http package use mlog for logging, the
log will be written to their predefined writers.

*  lib/memfs: check for possible nil on Get
+
In case the instance of memfs is set to nil (for example, the root
directory being watched is deleted on DirWatcher), the Get method will
cause panic after the next update on content of root directory.

*  lib/xmlrpc: use %v to convert non-string type on GetFieldAsString
+
Previously, if GetFieldAsString is called and the struct field type is
not string, it will return "%s(<type>=<value>)" instead of the value
in string.

This commit fix this issue by using %v to convert non-string type.

The domain now return invalid public key record, so we removed them
to make the test passed for now.

*  lib/memfs: move the test for NewWatcher and DirWatcher as example

With this we do one thing (write testing) and output two things (testing
the code and give an example for code).

*  lib/email: change the Header and Body fields on Message to non-pointer.
+
The idea is to minimize GC pressure on system with many messages,
minimize checking for nil value, and make an empty Message ready to use
without any initialization.

*  lib/smtp: refactoring NewClient to use struct instead of parameters.
+
Previously, to create new client one must pass three parameters to
NewClient function: localName, remoteURL, and insecure.
If we want to add another parameters in the future, it will cause the
function signature changes.
+
This changes simplify creating NewClient by passing single struct
with new parameters: AuthUser, AuthPass, and AuthMechanism.
If both AuthUser and AuthPass is not empty, the NewClient will
authenticate the connection, minimize number of step on the caller.

*  lib/smtp: rename Mechanism to SaslMechanism.

+
--
xtrk accept single file to uncompress and/or archived into a directory
output dir".
If directory output "dir" is not defined, it will be set to current
directory.

The compression and archive format is detected automatically based on the
following file input extension:

* .bz2: decompress using bzip2.
* .gz: decompress using gzip.
* .tar: unarchive using tar.
* .zip: unarchive using zip.
* .tar.bz2: decompress using bzip2 and unarchive using tar.

The value is based on recommendation by https://dnsflagday.net/2020/
to prevent IP fragmentation when supporting EDNS message.

*  lib/memfs: export the Remount method.
+
The Remount method reset the memfs instance to force rescanning
the files again from file system.

*  lib/email: set the Date and Message-ID on Message Pack.
+
--
Calling Pack now set the Date header if its not exist, using the local
time;  and the message-id header if its not exist using the following
format:

	<epoch>.<random-8-chars>@<local-hostname>

The random-8-chars is Seed-ed from Epoch(), so does the boundary.
--

*  lib/email: make Message Pack works with single text or HTML part.
+
Previously, the Pack method generate multipart/alternative message only.
+
Since the Message now can set the body text and HTML, without using
NewMultipart, the Pack method need to be able to accommodate this.

*  lib/email: add methods to modify Message.
+
Previously, a Message can be created only using NewMultipart, which
generate message with text and HTML.
+
This changes add methods to compose a Message: AddCC, AddTo, SetBodyHtml,
SetBodyText, SetCC, SetFrom, SetSubject, and SetTo.

*  lib/email: set the header Date field on NewMultipart.
+
The Date field value is set to current time on the system that
generated the message.
+
The date format is set to "Mon, 2 Jan 2006 15:04:05 -0700" according
to RFC 5322 section 3.3.

*  lib/smtp: add status codes from RFC 4954.
+
--
The following status codes are added,

* 432: StatusPasswordTransitionNeeded, from section 4.7.12.
* 454: StatusTemporaryAuthFailure, from section 4.7.0.
* 534: StatusAuthMechanismTooWeak, from section 5.7.9.
--

*  lib/mlog: make the Outf method always add new line at the end.
+
One of common mistakes when using logging library is to put the new line
"\n" at the end of format string, which cause delayed output written
to Stdout (the OS wait for "\n" as signal for printing).
+
This changes check new line to every call of Outf method and add it if
its not exist.
+
If the caller need to call Outf multiple times before ending it with
new line, they should handle it manually by storing into temporary
buffer first and call Outf at the end.

*  lib/memfs: add option CommentHeader to EmbedOptions.
+
The CommentHeader option allow user to define custom header to the Go
generated file.
The string value is not checked, whether it's a comment or not, it
will rendered as is.

*  lib/ini: make the Marshal on map field sorted by keys
+
--
Given the following struct,

----
type ADT struct {
	Amap map[string]string `ini:"section:sub"`
}
----

and ini text,

----
[test "map"]
c = 3
b = 2
a = 1
----

Unmarshal-ing the text into ADT and then Marshal-ing it again will
result in unpredictable keys order.

This changes fix this issue by sorting the keys on ADT.Amap on
Marshal-ing, to make the written output predictable.

+
Previously, if a sub-directory being watched by DirWatcher is renamed,
the old directory does not get removed from field dirs.
+
This commit fix this issue by deleting the sub directory on unmpSubdirs.
+
While at it, guard any read/write to dirs field with mutex to prevent
data race.

*  lib/dns: check for possible index out of range when unpacking RR.
+
There is a possibility that record data (rdata) length inside the
packet is greater than length of packet itself.  Some of the reasons are
corrupted packet from server or packet poisoning (attacking the DNS
server by sending invalid packet).

This changes fix this issue by checking the index and rdata length with
the length of packet before consuming the rdata itself.

The Extract function uncompress and/or unarchive file from fileInput
into directory defined by dirOutput.
This is the high level API that combine standard archive/zip, archive/tar,
compress/bzip2, and/or compress/gzip.

The compression and archive format is detected automatically based on
the following fileInput extension:

* .bz2: decompress using compress/bzip2.
* .gz: decompress using compress/gzip.
* .tar: unarchive using archive/tar.
* .zip: unarchive using archive/zip.
* .tar.bz2: decompress using compress/bzip2 and unarchive using
  archive/tar.
* .tar.gz: decompress using compress/gzip and unarchive using
  archive/tar.

The output directory, dirOutput, where the decompressed and/or unarchived
file stored. will be created if not exist.
If its empty, it will set to current directory.

On success, the compressed and/or archived file will be removed from the
file system.

Happy New Year!

Three years has passed since the first release of this multi-libraries (or Go
module), and we have released at least 33 new features with several bugs here
and there.

For anyone who use this module, I hope it help you, as the module name
intended "share", and sorry if its too many breaking changes.

Live long and prosper!
See you again next year.

[#v0_33_0_new_features]
===  New features

*  cmd/gofilemode: new command to decode the Go file mode
+
The Go has their own file mode that works across all operating system.
The file mode is represented by uint64, the command line will convert it
to fs.FileMode and print each possible flag on it including the
permission.

*  lib/sql: make the TruncateTable run with cascade and restart identity
+
--
On table that contains foreign key, truncate without cascade may cause
the method fail.

Also, since TruncateTable is, and should be only, used on testing, any
identity columns, for example serial, should be reset back to its initial
value. On PostgreSQL this means the truncate table is with
"RESTART IDENTITY".
--

*  cmd/epoch: command line to print and parse Unix timestamp
+
--
Program epoch print the current time (Unix seconds, milliseconds,
nanoseconds, local time, and UTC time) or the time based on the epoch on
first parameter.
Usage,

	epoch <unix-seconds|unix-milliseconds|unix-nanoseconds>

Without a parameter, it will print the current time.
With single parameter, it will print the time based on that epoch.

*  lib/http: refactoring NewClient to accept single struct
+
--
Previously, the NewClient function accept three parameters: serverURL,
http.Header, and insecure.  If we want to add another parameter,
for example timeout it will cause changes on the function signature.

To prevent this changes in the future, we change it now. The NewClient
now accept single struct.

While at it, we add option to set Timeout.

The Timeout affect the http Transport Timeout and TLSHandshakeTimeout.
The field is optional, if not set it will set to 10 seconds.
--

*  lib/http: remove field memfs.Options in ServerOptions
+
This options is duplicate with Memfs.Opts.

*  lib/websocket: add "ok" return value on ClientManager Context
+
The ok return value will be true if the context exist or false otherwise.

*  lib/memfs: remove field ContentEncoding from EmbedOptions and Node
+
--
The original idea for option ContentEncoding in EmbedOptions and Node
is to save spaces, compressing the content on disk on embedding and
doing transport, when the MemFS instance is used to serve the (embedded)
contents of file system.

This option turns out break the HTTP content negotiation [1] of
accept-encoding header, if the HTTP server does not handle it properly,
which default Go HTTP server does not.

In order to prevent this issue in the future, for anyone who use the
memfs for serving static HTTP contents, we remove the options and store
the embedded content as is and let the HTTP server handle how the
compression by itself.

*  lib/email: refacforing ParseMailbox
+
This commit changes the signature of ParseMailbox by returning no error.

*  lib/memfs: skip mount if the Root node has been initialized

*  lib/websocket: fix race conditition on handleText
+
Instead of accessing the ctx field directly, call the Context() method
to prevent data race.

*  lib/sql: check for EOF on loadSQL
+
--
There is probably a regression in Go that cause ioutil.ReadAll return
io.EOF, while it should not, because the documentation said that

	A successful call returns err == nil, not err == EOF.

But in this, using http.FileSystem, the ioutil.ReadAll now return EOF
and we need to check it to make the migration can run without an error.

+
This is to make the instance of memfs initialize from init is reusable.

*  lib/memfs: realign struct Node, Options, PathNode, and on unit tests

The realign save storage spaces on struct,

* Node: from 240 to 224 bytes (-16 bytes)
* Options: from 112 to 104 bytes (-8 bytes)
* PathNode: from 16 to 8 bytes (-8 bytes)

+
Since the ParseMailbox is public we can provide an examples and test
at the same times.
