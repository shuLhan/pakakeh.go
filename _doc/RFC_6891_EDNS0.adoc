=  Extension Mechanisms for DNS - EDNS(0)
:toc:
:sectlinks:

The
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6891[RFC 6891]
define the pseudo resource record (RR) or meta RR for DNS named OPT.

The OPT record provides an extension to DNS, nicknamed as "EDNS(0)", which
was previously called "EDNS0" specified in
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2671/[RFC 2671].

The OPT RR has RR type 41 (0x21).

The OPT record can only be added to the additional section of DNS response.

== Implementation requirements

OPT RRs MUST NOT be cached, forwarded, or stored in or loaded from master
files.

When an OPT RR is included within any DNS message, it MUST be the
only OPT RR in that message.
If a query message with more than one OPT RR is received, a FORMERR (format
error with response code (RCODE) value 1) MUST be returned.

== Record format

The OPT RR changes the definition of CLASS and TTL from normal DNS RR.

----
+--------+
| NAME   | ; 2-octets, MUST be 0 (an empty label).
+--------+
| TYPE   | ; 16-bit unsigned integer, with value 0x0029 (or 41)
+--------+
| CLASS  | ; 16-bit unsigned integer, requester's UDP payload size.
+--------+
| TTL    | ; 32-bit unsigned integer, extended RCODE and flags.
|        |
+--------+
| RDLEN  | ; 16-bit unsigned integer, length of RDATA.
+--------+
/ RDATA  / ; Arbitrary length based on RDLEN.
+--------+
----

Inside the TTL, the extended RCODE and flags define as below,

----
+----------------+
| EXTENDED-RCODE | 1-octet, the extended RCODE.
+----------------+
| VERSION        | 1-octet, version of implementation.
+----------------+
| DO             | 1-bit.
+----------------+
| Z              | 15-bit, zero bits.
+----------------+
----

Note that EXTENDED-RCODE value 0 indicates that an unextended RCODE is in
use.

The RDATA contains zero or more options as a pair of code-value in the
following format,

----
+---------------+
| OPTION-CODE   | ; 2-octets.
+---------------+
| OPTION-LENGTH | ; 2-octets, the length of value in octets.
+---------------+
/ OPTION-VALUE  / ; Arbitrary length of value based on OPTION-LENGTH;
+---------------+
