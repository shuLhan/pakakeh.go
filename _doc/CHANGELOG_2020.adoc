+
The new Assert function use the reflect.DoEqual that return an error
which describe which field have unmatched value.

[#v0_21_0_new_features]
===  New features

*  http: allow Endpoint to register custom error handler
+
The new field ErrorHandler on Endpoint allow the implementor to define
their own function to handler error from Endpoint.Call.
+
If the ErrorHandler is nil it will default to DefaultErrorHandler.

*  totp: new package that implement TOTP protocol
+
Package totp implement Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm based on
RFC 6238.

[#v0_21_0_bug_fixes]
===  Bug fixes

*  parser: fix Line method that always return non-empty line
+
In case of content end without new line, for example "a\nb", the Line()
method always return "b, 0" on the last line.

+
Previously, if the address is an IP address the returned value is empty,
for example "127.0.0.1" will return empty host but with non-nil IP and
port.

This changes always return the host either as host name (the same as
paremeter) or valid IP address.

[#v0_21_0_chores]
===  Chores

*  all: replace the tasks to serve and generate docs using ciigo as library

RoundToNearestAway round r to n digit precision using nearest away mode,
where mantissa is accumulated by the last digit after precision.
For example, using 2 digit precision, 0.555 would become 0.56.
+
RoundToZero round r to n digit precision using to zero mode.
For example, using 2 digit precision, 0.555 would become 0.55.

handled and filled automatically.

[#v0_20_0_enhancements]
===  Enhancements

* dns: serve DoT without SSL if server is behind proxy or tlsConfig is null.
+
Previously we only check for tlsConfig, if its null the DoT server

*  dns: unexport the Messsage's Packet field

*  dns: change the HostsFile Messages to list of ResourceRecord

*  dns: unexport the master file path field

*  dns: refactoring the ResourceRecord values from []byte to string
+
There are two reasons for this changes.  First, to allow JSON encoded
of ResourceRecord.Value without encoded to base64.
+
Second, to minimize unreleased packet due to the backing storage is
still used when assigned to Value (or any []byte field in RDataXXX).

*  dns: dns: split between MasterFile and masterParser
+
While at it add field Records that contains unpacked ResourceRecord as
mapping between domain and ResourceRecord.
+
This is useful for client that need to edit the RR in MasterFile.

*  http: do not return error based on response code
+
The error in doRequest should be about connection error, everything
else should be handled by user.

Instead of as methods in Server, we detach the LoadHostDir and
LostMasterDir into functions that return list of filename and their
content.

*  dns: disable serving DoH and DoT if port is not set (0)
+
Previously, if HTTPPort or TLSPort is not set (0) we set it to default

receive input as string and return itas command and list of arguments.
Unlike strings.Fields() which only separated the field by space,
ParseCommandArgs can detect possible single, double, or back quotes.
+
Another extension is Run() function that accept the string command
to be executed and their standard output and error.

*  sql: add method to migrate database schema
+
The Migrate method migrate the database using list of SQL files inside
