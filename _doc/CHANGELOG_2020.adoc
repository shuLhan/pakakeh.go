The new Assert function use the reflect.DoEqual that return an error
which describe which field have unmatched value.

[#v0_21_0_new_features]
===  New features

*  http: allow Endpoint to register custom error handler
+
The new field ErrorHandler on Endpoint allow the implementor to define
their own function to handler error from Endpoint.Call.
+
If the ErrorHandler is nil it will default to DefaultErrorHandler.

*  totp: new package that implement TOTP protocol

RFC 6238.

[#v0_21_0_bug_fixes]
===  Bug fixes

*  parser: fix Line method that always return non-empty line
+
In case of content end without new line, for example "a\nb", the Line()
method always return "b, 0" on the last line.

+
Previously, if the address is an IP address the returned value is empty,
for example "127.0.0.1" will return empty host but with non-nil IP and
port.

This changes always return the host either as host name (the same as
paremeter) or valid IP address.

[#v0_21_0_chores]
===  Chores

*  all: replace the tasks to serve and generate docs using ciigo as library

+
RoundToNearestAway round r to n digit precision using nearest away mode,
where mantissa is accumulated by the last digit after precision.
For example, using 2 digit precision, 0.555 would become 0.56.
+
RoundToZero round r to n digit precision using to zero mode.
For example, using 2 digit precision, 0.555 would become 0.55.

handled and filled automatically.

[#v0_20_0_enhancements]
===  Enhancements

* dns: serve DoT without SSL if server is behind proxy or tlsConfig is null.
+
Previously we only check for tlsConfig, if its null the DoT server

*  dns: unexport the Messsage's Packet field

*  dns: change the HostsFile Messages to list of ResourceRecord

*  dns: unexport the master file path field

*  dns: refactoring the ResourceRecord values from []byte to string
+
There are two reasons for this changes.  First, to allow JSON encoded
of ResourceRecord.Value without encoded to base64.
+
Second, to minimize unreleased packet due to the backing storage is
still used when assigned to Value (or any []byte field in RDataXXX).

*  dns: dns: split between MasterFile and masterParser
+
While at it add field Records that contains unpacked ResourceRecord as
mapping between domain and ResourceRecord.
+
This is useful for client that need to edit the RR in MasterFile.

Messages.

*  http: do not return error based on response code
+
The error in doRequest should be about connection error, everything

LostMasterDir into functions that return list of filename and their
content.

+
Previously, if HTTPPort or TLSPort is not set (0) we set it to default

ParseCommandArgs can detect possible single, double, or back quotes.
+
Another extension is Run() function that accept the string command
to be executed and their standard output and error.

*  sql: add method to migrate database schema
