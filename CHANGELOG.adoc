[#v0_50_0]
== share v0.50.0 (2023-10-04)

This release bring many enhancements thanks to linters like revive [1],
fieldaligment [2], and shadow [3].

This release also replace "math/rand.Seed" with "crypto/rand".
Since Go 1.20 the "math/rand.Seed" is considered deprecated (the initial
value of rand is seeded automatically, not zero).
Now, it is the time to replace "math/rand" with more secure random number
generator, from "crypto/rand".
This changes affect tests in package "lib/email", "lib/http", and
"lib/stmp".

[#v0_50_0__breaking_changes]
===  Breaking changes

lib/test: refactoring, rename TestWriter to BufferWriter::
+
--
The name TestWriter is considered stutter if its called from external
package, test.TestWriter.

While at it, implement the Error and Errorf in BufferWriter and add
comment to each exported methods.
--

ssh/sftp: rename method Close to CloseFile::
+
Since the method accept FileHandle, that is returned from OpenFile,
then the method should changed with the same suffix.
This is also to make the method un-ambiguous later when we add Close method
to close client connection.

[#v0_50_0__new_features]
===  New features

lib/errors: implement method Is::
+
The Is method will return true if the target error is instance of *E
and the value of field Code and Name match with values in e.

lib/email: add method ID to Header::
+
The ID method return the Message-ID or empty if its not exist.

test/mock: implement mock for testing io.ReadWriter or io.StringWriter::
+
--
The type ReadWriter provide two buffers, BufRead and BufWrite.
The BufRead is for io.Reader and BufWrite for io.Writer or
io.StringWriter.

The type provide one method helper, Reset, to reset all buffers.
--

lib/crypto: add function LoadPrivateKeyInteractive::
+
--
The LoadPrivateKeyInteractive load the private key from file.
If the private key file is encrypted, it will prompt for the passphrase
from terminal.

This function is taken from package "lib/ssh" with modification by adding
parameter "io.ReadWriter" and removing parameter maxAttempt.
--

lib/crypto: implement RSA encrypt and decryption for large message size::
+
--
The EncryptOaep extend the "rsa.EncryptOAEP" to make it able to encrypt a
message larger than its than (public modulus size - 2*hash.Size - 2).

The function signature is the same with "rsa.EncryptOAEP" except the
name, to make it distinguishable.

The DecryptOaep function extend the "rsa.DecryptOAEP" to make it able to
decrypt a message larger than its public modulus size.
--

ssh/sftp: add method to close client connection::
+
The Close method close the client sftp session and release all its
resources.

lib/ssh: add method Close to Client::
+
The Close method close the client connection and release all resources.


[#v0_50_0__enhancements]
===  Enhancements

_AUR: include go-mod-tip.sh to package::
+
The "go-mod-tip.sh" is a shell script to get and print the latest Go module
version based on the latest tag and the latest commit hash from current
working git directory.

lib/crypto: rewrite LoadPrivateKey as wrapper of ssh.ParseRawPrivate::
+
--
Previously, the LoadPrivateKey function only able to load private key
with PKCS#1 format.

This changes make the function as a wrapper for ssh.ParseRawPrivate
that can load RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and Ed25519 in PKCS#1, PKCS#8, OpenSSL,
and OpenSSH formats.
--

lib/ssh: store and use the connected identity file for ScpPut and ScpGet::
+
Previously, the ScpPut and ScpGet use the first IdentityFile in section
to use in "-i" argument.
This is not correct.
If the section contains two or more IdentityFile and the one that can
connect are the last one, the ScpPut and ScpGet method may return an
error when executing the "scp" command.

[#v0_49_1]
== share v0.49.1 (2023-09-02)

[#v0_49_1__bug_fixes]
===  Bug fixes

lib/dns: fix leaking internal zone::
+
--
Previously, if the server have internal zone "my.internal" and the client
query "sub.my.internal" that does not exist in the zone, the server then
forward the query to parent name server.
This cause the internal zone and its domains leaked to parent name server.

This changes fix this issue by checking if the query is subset of
internal zone Origin if domain does not exist, and response with error
code 3 (ERR_NAME) with the Zone SOA in Authority.
--

[#v0_49_1__enhancements]
=== Enhancements

lib/dns: update the SOA Serial when record added or removed from Zone::
+
Any call to Zone Add or Remove methods will update the Zone.SOA.Serial to
current epoch.

lib/dns: add method AddAuthority to Message::
+
--
The AddAuthority add the rr to list of Authority.
Calling this method mark the message as answer, instead of query.

If the rr is SOA, it will replace the existing record if exist and set
the flag authoritative answer (IsAA) in header to true.
If the rr is NS, it will be added only if its not exist.

It will return an error if the rr type is not SOA or NS or the size of
records in Authority is full, maximum four records.
--

lib/dns: add method to populate internal caches by Zone::
+
The InternalPopulateZone populate the internal caches from Zone's
messages.

ssh/config: handle key UserKnownHostsFile::
+
The UserKnownHostsFile define list of the known_hosts files to be read,
separated by spaces.
If not set default to "~/.ssh/known_hosts" and "~/.ssh/known_hosts2".


lib/ssh: use UserKnownHostFile from configuration in NewClientInteractive::
+
--
Previously, the ssh Client always use InsecureIgnoreHostKey in
HostKeyCallback.
This may post security issue, like man-in-the-middle attack, since we
did not check the server host key with one of key that known by client
from UserKnownHostFile (for example ~/.ssh/known_hosts).

This changes use the SSH section UserKnownHostFile from configuration
(default to ~/.ssh/known_hosts) to check if the server host key is
valid.
The NewClientInteractive will return an error, "key is unknown", if host
key not exist in UserKnownHostFile or "key is mismatch" if host key
not match with one registered in UserKnownHostFile.

This changes depends on patch of golang.org/x/crypto [1] that has not
reviewed yet, so we need to replace it with one that contains the patch.

[#v0_49_0]
== share v0.49.0 (2023-08-04)

[#v0_49_0__breaking_changes]
=== Breaking changes

lib/email: refactoring, replace field with type []byte to string::
+
Using string provide safety, guaranteed that if we pass it as parameter
the receiver will not be able to modify its content.

ssh/config: refactoring, simplify the Section fields::
+
--
Instead of storing each Section value in separate field, store them
inside a map, Field.
This reduce the size of Section and simplify adding or getting the
key that we are not supported but maybe usable by user in the future.

This changes introduce several new methods as replacement of field:

* CASignatureAlgorithms: a method that return list of signature
  algorithms that Section set or the default
* CanonicalDomains: a method that return CanonicalDomains set in Section
* CanonicalizePermittedCNames: return the permitted CNAMEs set in Section,
  from KeyCanonicalizePermittedCNames.
* CertificateFile: return list of certificate file
* Environments: return system and/or custom environment that will be
  passed to remote machine.
  The key and value is derived from "SendEnv" and "SetEnv".
* FieldBool: return field value as boolean
* FieldInt: return the field value as int
* Hostname: return the Hostname in this Section
* IdentityAgent: return the path to SSH agent socket to be used
* Port: return the remote machine port
* User: return the remote user name
* Set: set the Field using key and value
--

lib/ssh: refactoring NewClientFromConfig, renamed to NewClientInteractive::
+
--
Previously, the NewClientInteractive blindly use the signers from
Section.Signers.
If one of the IdentityFile valid, it will add all the keys in
IdentityFile to SSH agent.

In this changes we try each IdentityFile independently.
If the key is valid, client connected to remote machine, then only that
key will be added to SSH agent.

While at it we also rename the method to NewClientInteractive to
indicate that the function will prompt for passphrase if one of the
IdentityFile is encrypted.

[#v0_49_0__bug_fixes]
=== Bug fixes

lib/http: fix missing query when handling redirect in HandleFS::
+
In 06e6cbdd511c, we redirect request by adding end slash to the path
if the requested resource is directory, but somehow we miss adding the
original request query.
This changes fix this issue.

lib/os: check for extract path in untar and unzip::
+
--
Once we Join-ed the directory output with the file name, we check if
the result of join is still under directory output, if its not, return
an error to prevent
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html[Zip Slip vulnerability].
--

lib/smtp: format the passed data in NewMailTx::
+
--
The following rules are applied to the data,

* all lines must end with CRLF
* if the line start with period, additional period is inserted before
  the line. This recommendation based on RFC 5321 section 4.5.2 [1] to
  prevent data that contains CRLF "." CRLF does not corrupt the message,
  causing the server terminate reading the message where it should not.

[1] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321#section-4.5.2

[#v0_49_0__new_features]
=== New features

lib/os: add function PathFold and PathUnfold::
+
--
The PathFold replace the path "in" with tilde "~" if its prefix match
with user's home directory from os.UserHomeDir.

The PathUnfold expand the tilde "~/" prefix into user's home directory
using os.UserHomeDir and environment variables using os.ExpandEnv
inside the string path "in".
--

lib/os: add function Environments::
+
The Environments function return list of system environment as map of
key and value.

lib/ssh: add function LoadPrivateKeyInteractive::
+
The LoadPrivateKeyInteractive load private key from file.
If key is encrypted, it will prompt the passphrase in terminal with
maximum maxAttempt times.
If the passphrase still invalid after maxAttempt it will return an error.

[#v0_49_0__enhancements]
=== Enhancements

lib/smtp: set minimum Server TLS to v1.2::
+
Using the TLS v1.1 is considered insecure and should not be used in
server anymore.

lib/memfs: check for refresh URL outside of Root SysPath::
+
The case when refresh URL outside of Root SysPath is only exist when
the memfs TryDirect is set to true, usually during development.
In the production, the TryDirect should be false, hence the refresh
always return nil Node.

ssh/config: reorder struct fields for better alignment::
+
--
Changes,

* Config: changes allocated size from 32 to 16 bytes (-8 bytes)
* parser: changes allocated size from 40 to 32 bytes (-8 bytes)
* Section: changes allocated size from 392 to 360 bytes (-32 bytes)

The rest of changes that are not mentioned are from test files.

[#v0_48_0]
==  share v0.48.0 (2023-07-07)

This release bring many enhancements to lib/websocket including timeout,
handling upgrade and read/write concurrently using goroutine.

[#v0_48_0__breaking_changes]
=== Breaking changes

lib/net: changes the WaitRead/Event model on Poll::
+
--
Previously, the Pool's WaitRead and WaitReadEVent methods return list of
file descriptor (fd) and keeps the fd in the pool.
In case we want to process the returned fd concurrently, by running it
in different goroutine, the next call WaitRead may return the same fd
if its goroutine not fast enough to read from fd.

This changes fix this issue by removing list of fd from poll and set the
fd flag to blocking mode again after returning it from WaitRead or
WaitReadEvent.

This changes also remove the ReregisterRead and ReregisterEvent methods
since it is not applicable anymore.
--

[#v0_48_0__bug_fixes]
=== Bug fixes

lib/websocket: call Quit when handshake contains close or invalid frame::
+
If the HTTP handshake response contains trailing frame, handle it
directly.
If the frame is invalid or contains control close operation, call Quit
directly to trigger the HandleQuit if its defined by user.

lib/websocket: revert maxBuffer back to 1024::
+
In v0.47.0 we increase the maxBuffer to 4096 to try increasing the
performance when handling large payload.
Turns out increasing this break the autobahn test suite.


[#v0_48_0__new_features]
=== New features

lib/ascii: add type Set::
+
--
The Set type is a bitmap that represent list of ASCII characters for faster
lookup.

A Set is a 36-byte value, where each bit in the first 32-bytes represents
the presence of a given ASCII character in the set.
The remaining 4-bytes is a counter for the number of ASCII characters in the
set.
The 128-bits of the first 16 bytes, starting with the least-significant bit of
the lowest word to the most-significant bit of the highest word, map to the
full range of all 128 ASCII characters.
The 128-bits of the next 16 bytes will be zeroed, ensuring that any non-ASCII
character will be reported as not in the set.
--

lib/net: implement generic PollEvent::
+
--
The PollEvent contains file descriptor and the underlying event
based on OS, unix.EpollEvent on Linux or unix.Kevent_t on BSD.

The Poll interface provides two APIs to works with PollEvent,
WaitReadEvents that return list of PollEvent ready for read, and
ReregisterEvent to register the event back to poll (only for Linux).
--

[#v0_48_0__enhancements]
=== Enhancements

lib/websocket: add option to set read/write timeout on Server::
+
--
The ReadWriteTimeout define the maximum duration the server wait when
receiving/sending packet from/to client before considering the
connection as broken.

Default read-write timeout is 30 seconds if not set.

This changes affect the exported function Send and Recv by adding
additional parameter timeout to both of them.
--

lib/websocket: handle concurrent upgrade using goroutine::
+
--
The maxGoroutineUpgrader define maximum goroutines running at the same
time to handle client upgrade.
The new goroutine only dispatched when others are full, so it will
run incrementally not all at once.
Default to defServerMaxGoroutineUpgrader (128) if its not set.
--

lib/websocket: handle concurrent Server read using goroutines::
+
The Server now dispatch a goroutine to consume event from poll reader
for each client connection that is ready to read.
The maximum number of goroutine is defined in ServerOptions
maxGoroutineReader, which currently set to 1024.

lib/websocket: handle concurrent ping using goroutines::
+
The maximum goroutines is quarter of max queue.
The new goroutine for pinger will be dispatched when no goroutine can
consume the current processed connection.


[#v0_48_0__chores]
===  Chores

websocket/testdata: rewrite autobahn test using container::
+
--
Since the autobahn script can only run on Python 2, it become hard to
setup and run the test on distro that does not provide Python 2 anymore.
The autobahn repository recommend to use docker instead.

When testing the server, we simplify it by using make task "test-server".
The test-server task run our test server in background, and then run the
autobahn fuzzingclient from container.
Once the tests completed, we trigger the server to shutdown by sending
text frame with payload "shutdown".

When testing the client, we simplify it by using make task "test-client".
The test-client task run the autobahn fuzzingserver and then
we run our client.
Once client finished, we trigger the server to generate the reports
and cleanup the container.

===  Breaking changes

email/maildir: major refactoring plus adding unit tests::
+
This changes remove all unneeded methods from Manager leave it with
four methods: Delete, FetchNew, Incoming, OutgoingQueue.
+
Also, we add the type filename to generate file name for tmp and new
directory.

lib/email: unexport the field ContentType in the field::
+
The field ContentType will be set only when the field Name is
"Content-Type" so it's not always exist on each field.
To get the field ContentType, use Header.ContentType().


[#v0_47_0__bug_fixes]
=== Bug fixes

lib/dns: fix zone parsing on SOA record with single line::
+
Due to refactoring in c376eccd25, parsing SOA record with single line
return an error: "parseSOA: line 2: incomplete SOA statement '0'".

lib/memfs: ignore permission error when scanning directory content::
+
Instead of returning error, skip the directory that we cannot read and
continue to process the other.

lib/memfs: fix panic when watched file deleted or renamed::
+
When the file being watched is deleted, sometimes it will cause panic.

lib/email: fix parsing multiple parameters in ContentType::
+
While at it, also fix the ContentType String method to prefix ';' before
appending parameter key and value.


[#v0_47_0__new_features]
=== New features

cmd/bcrypt: CLI to compare or generate hash using bcrypt::
+
The bcrypt command has two subcommand "compare" and "gen".
The "compare" subcommand accept two parameter the hash and plain text.
The "gen" subcommand accept only one parameter, the plain text to be hashed.

lib/sql: add type DmlKind::
+
The DmlKind define the kind for Data Manipulation Language.

email/maildir: implement Folder::
+
Folder is a directory under maildir that store messages per file.
A folder contains three directories: tmp, new, and cur; and an empty
file "maildirfolder".

lib/net: add function WaitAlive::
+
--
WaitAlive try to connect to network at address until timeout reached.
If connection cannot established it will return an error.

Unlike [net.DialTimeout], this function will retry not returning an error
immediately if the address has not ready yet.
--

lib/smtp: implement Client SendEmail::
+
--
Somehow in 3a1a2715b25f, we include this method without implementing it.

The SendEmail method simplify sending email by automatically create
[MailTx] for passing it to method Client.MailTx.

The test right now use live connection since the Server is not ready yet.

lib/dns: add option to set debug level in ServerOptions::
+
This options replace the global debug package.

lib/dns: do not cache empty answers::
+
The use case if one use and switch between two different
networks with internal zone, frequently.
For example, if on network Y they have domain MY.Y and
current connection is X, request to MY.Y will return an
empty answers.
Once they connect to Y again, any request to MY.Y will not
be possible because rescached caches contains empty answer
for MY.Y.

_bin/go-test-coverhtml: add parameter to run specific test::
+
The second parameter is optional.
It is passed to -run= argument in "go test".
Default value is ".", or all functions.

lib/http: redirect path with slash if request is directory::
+
--
If request path is a directory and it is not end with slash, redirect
request to location with slash to allow relative links works inside the
HTML content.

For example, a "/page/index.html" contains links href="sub.html" (where
"sub.html" is inside "/page" directory).
If request to "/page" (without end with slash) return content of
"/page/index.html", then when user click on sub.html it will request to
"/sub.html" instead of "/page/sub.html".
--

lib/email: handle obsolete white spaces and comment when unpacking date::
+
--
In the obsolete syntax, white space and comments can appear between many
more element, for example the folloing Date value are valid

	Date  : Fri, 21 Nov 1997 09(comment):   55  :  06 -0600

This changes handle this by sanitizing the Field value, removing comment
and merge multiple spaces into one, before parsing it.
--

lib/email: set the Field Type and unpack its value on ParseField::
+
--
Once the field Name has detected and its Value is valid, we can unpack
the Value based to type that it represent, for example to Date or Mailbox.

This changes remove calling to unpack directly in some tests and check
an error when testing ParseHeader.
--

lib/net: increase the maximum poll events::
+
The maxQueue define the number of events that can be read from poll at
one time.
Using 128 seems to small for high throughput networks.
Increasing this number also increase the memory consumed by process.
Maybe later we can export this function as option when creating poll.

lib/websocket: increase the max buffer and queue for better throughput::
+
--
The maxBuffer increased from 1024 to 4096 bytes.
The reason that we use 1024 previously is related to MTU size and maximum
payload in TCP (although its higher, 1460 bytes).

The maxQueue increase from 128 to 4096.

This release deprecated lib/io and lib/parser.


[#v0_46_0__breaking_changes]
===  Breaking changes

lib/reflect: remove the third return value from Marshal::
+
The third, boolean, return value is redundant with the second error value.

lib/bytes: changes the DumpPrettyTable output format::
+
The change is to accommodate large bytes data, more than 0xFFFF.
The hex address in the first column is increased to 8 digits, the
characters compacted without space in between.


[#v0_46_0__new_features]
===  New features

lib/os: merge some functions from lib/io::
+
Functions like Copy, IsBinary, IsDirEmpty, IsFileExist, RmdirEmptyAll
are read and operate on file and directory on operating system level, so
it is not correct to put it in package io.

lib/strings: merge lib/parser here::
+
--
The first idea of parser is to provide generic parser for both bytes and
string.
After we introduce lib/parser there is not much changes to that package.
Also, since we create another Parser in lib/bytes that accept and
return token as []byte, the lib/parser is not unique anymore.

The following function/methods changes to minimize conflict in the future,

* Lines become LinesOfFile
* New become NewParser
* Open become OpenForParser
* Token become Read
* TokenEscaped become ReadEscaped
* TokenTrimSpace become ReadNoSpace
--

lib/bytes: implement function ParseHexDump::
+
--
The ParseHexDump parse the default output of [hexdump](1) utility from
parameter in back into stream of byte.

An example of default output of hexdump is

	0000000 7865 5f70 6964 2f72 0000 0000 0000 0000
	0000010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
	*
	0000060 0000 0000 3030 3030 3537 0035 3030 3130

The first column is the address and the rest of the column is the data.
Each data column is 16-bit words in big-endian order, so in the above
example, the first byte would be 65, second byte is 78 and so on.
The asterisk "*" means that the address from 0000020 to 0000050 is equal to
the previous line, 0000010.

lib/bytes: implement tokenize Parser::
+
The Parser type parse stream of byte using one or more delimiters as
separator between token.

lib/bytes: add function TrimNull::
+
The TrimNull function remove 0 value ("\0" or NULL in C) at leading
and trailing of input.

+
This allow user to call the Next method, to know the next time the
scheduler will be triggered, after receiving the event.

+
A struct's field tagged with `noequal:""`, its value will not be processed for
equality.


[#v0_46_0__chores]

lib/reflect: use doEqual inside IsEqual::
+
Previously, IsEqual internally use isEqual, which have the same logic as
doEqual.
This changes minimize duplicate code between IsEqual and DoEqual, by
calling doEqual for both of functions.

lib/time: replace lib/io#Reader with lib/bytes#Parser::

lib/smtp: replace lib/io#Reader with lib/bytes#Parser::

lib/dns: replace lib/io#Reader with lib/bytes#Parser::

+
--
Previously, PopulateQuery only add the passed dname if the number of dots
is greater than 0.
After inspecting the result from dig and getenv, the dots seems does not

predefined linter, in the current directory.

Arg 1: the method or function to test, default to ".".

The linter program and its argument is derived from environment variable
GO_LINT.
If its empty, it will try the following linter in order: revive and then

The ParseZone parse the content of zone from raw bytes.

Now that we have ParseZone, all tests that use zoneParser now can be
replaced using combination of test.Data and ParseZone.

lib/dns: add method WriteTo to Zone::
+
--
The WriteTo method write the zone as text into io.Writer.

The result of WriteTo will be different with original content of zone
file, since it does not preserve comment and indentation.

lib/dns: fix packing, parsing, and saving MINFO resource data::
+
--
Even thought the MINFO record not formally obsolete, according to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#Obsolete_record_types[Wikipedia],
we still need to support this for backward compatibility.

When packing the resource data length does not include total length.
When parsing, the RMailBox and EmailBox should be added the origin suffix
if its not end with dot.
When saving, the origin should be trimmed from RMailBox and EmailBox.
--

lib/dns: fix packing and unpacking resource record HINFO::
+
--
The rdata for HINFO contains two character-strings: CPU and OS.
Previously, we pack the rdata section sequentially, without adding length
on each of them: <RDLEN><CPU><OS>.
The correct pack format should <RDLEN><LENGTH><CPU><LENGTH><OS>.
--

lib/dns: fix parsing SRV record from zone file::
+
--
Previous parseSRV start by parsing the _Service from tok, but the
actual value of parameter tok is the Priority.

This changes fix this and as testing we use the example from RFC 2782.

lib/dns: allow parsing TXT rdata without quote in zone file::
+
--
Previously, the zone only parsing TXT record with double quote since
most of the example that we found during implementation all use double
quote.

This changes allow non-double quoted text in zone file with consequence
that any spaces will terminated the rdata immediately.

Fixes #6
--

lib/dns: handle zone file with CRLF line ending::
+
--
While at it, fix parsing multiline SOA record where closing parentheses
end on next lines.

Fixes #6

lib/test: simplify the string diff output from Assert::
+
--
In the output, instead of using %q we replace it with %s, because printing
string with double quote cause escaping and hard to read
This change may cause difference in white spaces not showed in the
terminal.

In the diff changes, only print the Old and New, without printing each
chunk.
