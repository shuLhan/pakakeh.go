The following is a '''list of [[United Nations]] resolutions that concern [[Israel]]''' and bordering states such as [[Lebanon]] From [[1967]] to [[1989]]<!-- does anybody have the numbers for the full period from 1946 through today?--> the [[UN Security Council]] passed 131 [[United Nations Security Council resolution|resolutions]] directly addressing the Arab-Israeli conflict. In early Security Council practice, resolutions did not directly invoke [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII]]. They made an explicit determination of a threat, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, and ordered an action in accordance with Article 39 or 40. Resolution 54 determined that a threat to peace existed within the meaning of Article 39 of the Charter, reiterated the need for a truce, and ordered a cease-fire pursuant to Article 40 of the Charter. Although the phrase "Acting under Chapter VII" was never mentioned as the basis for the action taken, the chapter’s authority was being used.<ref>see [http://www.pcr.uu.se/publications/UCDP_pub/Chapter%20VII%20Resolutions_050921.pdf  Patrik Johansson, UN Security Council Chapter VII resolutions, 1946-2002.
