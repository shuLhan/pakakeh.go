Package ini implement reading and writing INI text format as defined by
[Git configuration] file syntax.

# Features

  - Reading and writing on the same file should not change the content of
    file (including comment).

  - Template friendly, through [Ini.Val], [Ini.Vals], and [Ini.Subs].

# Unsupported features

Git "include" and "includeIf" directives.

In Git specification, an empty variable is equal to boolean true.  This
cause inconsistency between empty string and boolean true.

# Syntax

The '#' and ';' characters begin comments to the end of line.

Blank lines are ignored.

# Section

A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets.

A section continues until the next section begins.

Section name are case-insensitive.

Section name must start with an alphabetic character, no
spaces before name or after '['.

Section name only allow alphanumeric characters, '-' and '.'.

Section can be further divided into subsections.

Section headers cannot span multiple lines.

You can have "[section]" if you have `[section "subsection"]`, but
you donâ€™t need to.

All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the
section header) are recognized as setting variables, in the form
`name = value`.

# Subsection

A subsection begin and end with double quotes, separated by
space from the section name, in the section header, for example

	[section "subsection"]

Subsection name is case sensitive and can contain any characters
except newline and the null byte.

Subsection name can include doublequote `"` and backslash '\' by
escaping them as in `\"` and `\\`, respectively.

Other backslashes preceding other characters are dropped when
reading subsection name; for example, "\t" is read as "t" and "\0" is read
as "0".

# Variable

Variable name must start with an alphabetic character.

Variable must belong to some section, which means that there
must be a section header before the first setting of a variable.

Variable name are case-insensitive.

Variable name allow only alphanumeric characters and '-'.

NOTE: This library add extension to allow dot ('.') and underscore ('_')
characters on variable name.

# Value

Value can be empty or not set.
Variable name without value is a short-hand to set the value to the empty
string value, for example

	[section]
	thisisempty # equal to thisisempty=

Internal whitespaces within the value are retained verbatim.
Leading and trailing whitespaces on value without double quote will
be discarded.

	key = multiple strings     # equal to "multiple strings"
	key = " multiple strings " # equal to " multiple strings "

Value can be continued to the next line by ending it with a backslash '\'
character, the backslash and the end-of-line are stripped.

	key = multiple \           # equal to "multiple string"
	strings

Value can contain inline comment, for example

	key = value # this is inline comment

Comment characters, '#' and ';', inside double quoted value will be
read as content of value, not as comment,

	key = "value # with hash"

Inside a value enclosed by double quotes, the following escape sequences
are recognized: '\"' for doublequote, '\\' for backslash, '\n' for newline
character (NL), '\t' for horizontal tabulation (HT, TAB) and '\b' for
backspace (BS).

Other character escape sequences (including octal escape sequences) are
invalid.

# Marshaling

The container to be passed when marshaling must be struct type.
Each exported field in the struct with "ini" tag is marshaled based
on the section, subsection, and key in the tag's value.

The "ini" tag syntax is,

	[SECTION] [':' SUBSECTION] [':' VAR]

At least one of the section, subsection, or key should be defined.

The subsection can contain colon and double quote.
A colon ':' is escaped using double backslash '\\', for example "a:b\\:c:d"
contains section "a", subsection "b:c", and variable "d".
A double quote is escaped using triple backslash, for example `\\\"`.

If the field type is slice of primitive, for example "[]int", it will be
marshaled into multiple key with the same name.
Note that, marshaling "[]byte" does not supported, due to ambiguity between
"byte" and "uint8" during reflection.

If the field type is struct, it will marshaled as new section and/or
subsection based on tag on the struct field

If the field type is slice of struct, it will marshaled as multiple
section-subsection with the same tags.

Map type is supported as long as the key is string, otherwise it will be
ignored.
The map key will be marshaled as key.

Other standard type that supported is time.Time, which will be rendered
with the time format defined in "layout" tag.

Example,

	type U struct {
		Int `ini:"::int"`
	}

	type T struct {
		String      string            `ini:"single::string"
		Time        time.Time         `ini:"single::time" layout:"2006-01-02"`
		SliceString []string          `ini:"slice::string"
		Struct      U                 `ini:"single:struct"
		SliceStruct []U               `ini:"slice:struct"
		Map         map[string]int    `ini:"amap:"
		MapSub      map[string]string `ini:"amap:sub"
		MapStruct   map[string]U      `ini:"mapstruct"`
	}

will be marshaled into

	[single]
	string = <value of T.String>
	time = <value of T.Time with layout "YYYY-MM-DD">

	[slice]
	string = <value of T.SliceString[0]>
	...
	string = <value of T.SliceString[n]>

	[single "struct"]
	int = <value of T.U.Int>

	[slice "struct"]
	int = <value of T.SliceStruct[0].Int

	[slice "struct"]
	int = <value of T.SliceStruct[n].Int

	[amap]
	<T.Map.Key[0]> = <T.Map.Value[0]>
	...
	<T.Map.Key[n]> = <T.Map.Value[n]>

	[amap "sub"]
	<T.MapSub.Key[0]> = <T.MapSub.Value[0]>
	...
	<T.MapSub.Key[n]> = <T.MapSub.Value[n]>

	## On map[string]struct, each key become a subsection.
	[mapstruct "<map.key[0]>"]
	<U.Field[0]> = <U.Value[0]>
	...
	<U.Field[n]> = <U.Value[n]>

	...

	[mapstruct "<map.key[n]>"]
	<U.Field[0]> = <U.Value[0]>
	...
	<U.Field[n]> = <U.Value[n]>

# Unmarshaling

The syntax and rules for unmarshaling is equal to the marshaling.
